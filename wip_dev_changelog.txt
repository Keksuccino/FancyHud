Beta 1

- Required FM version is now 3.4.6+
- Added "Overlay Remover" element to remove/hide overlay types like the pumpkin head overlay, powder snow overlay, world border vignette, etc.
- Replaced placeholder logo textures with Spiffy's actual new logo
- Removed unsupported "Render Custom Elements Behind Vanilla" option, because HUD layouts will always render behind Vanilla HUD elements (and after overlays like portal, pumpkin, vignette, etc.)
- Fixed transparent images hiding parts of the hotbar when rendered behind it (this was actually caused by Vanilla)
